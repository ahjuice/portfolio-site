# ahjuice.me - My Portfolio Site

My portfolio of website/coding projects. For simplicity and performance, and to demonstrate a focus on web foundations, I have decided for the time to write this entirely in HTML5 and CSS3. Will I add JS, server-side stuff, or some library or framework down the line? Perhaps. But for now, this will do.

## Getting Started

Nothing special to install. No Ruby, no PHP, no npm packages. Just clone this repo down and open up index.html. Wild, right?

If you'd like to run a simple local web server, and you have Python installed, you can `cd` into the cloned directory and type this into your terminal:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

### Prerequisites

A computer and a modern web browser. Sorry, users of IE9 and below.

## Deployment

Whoo, have I got options for you! You can deploy this on pretty much any web host in existence. Transfer the files via FTP, rsync them, use git hooks, upload via web browser... the world is your oyster. Though I hope you aren't deploying MY site specifically because that... that would be weird. As much as I enjoy extra publicity, please don't do that.

## Built With

- HTML5 and
- CSS3.

It's almost revolutionary.

## Contributing

Though HTML5 and CSS3 are fundamental, it's deceptively easy to miss good patterns! If you find issues with structure, accessibility, or anything else, I welcome your feedback. Please raise an issue so we can discuss, and once we've reached an agreement, you are totally welcome to submit a pull request. I'll look it over, merge it, and the world will be a slightly better place for everyone!\*

\*I can't actually guarantee this. :(

## License

I'm a simple man. This is all pretty standard HTML/CSS. It's already based on a template, so if you want to use it as a slightly-more-specific-code-portfolio template, be my guest. Just, you know, don't use my name and picture. Because again, that's weird.
